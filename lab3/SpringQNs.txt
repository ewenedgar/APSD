1. what is spring?
	In java, spring is aims at simplifying complex and cumbersome
	enterprise Java applications by use of technologies such as
	 Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control,  convention over 
	configuration and auto-configuration making it suitable for 
	building modern, scalable web applications.

2. What is Spring Boot?

	Is an open source tool used for microservice-based, production grade and 
	stand-alone java web framework development offered by Sprinng projects.

3. What is the relation between Spring platform and Spring Boot?

	Spring platform is a container built on java proving Spring core, spring framework, and spring projects;
	Spring Boot is a project among many of what the Spring platform avails.

4. What is the relation between Spring platform and Spring framework?
	A spring platform is the container that supports the development of 
	the spring framework.

	Spring framework contrary is an implementation of spring core offering
	Inversion of control, Dependency Injection, Spring context etc.

5. What is Dependency Injection and how is it done in the Spring platform/framework?
	Dependency injections argues largely that in order to use a thing, one does not need to
	to create it. So dependency injection is where objects are not necessarily
	created by the using class.
	It is achieved in spring through; Field Injection, Constructor Injection, Method injection.

6. What is Inversion of Control (IoC) and how is it related to Spring?
	Inversion Of control is what the spring framework does best through creating objects and managing them
	by injecting dependencies into them.
